        First, a nice mortar is prepared for Lahmacun. Minced meat is minced in
        the region of the veal called breast, our mortar is prepared by adding
        red pepper, green pepper, onion, parsley, natural paste made in the
        villages and plenty of spices, and our mortar is rested in the
        refrigerator for 2 hours. While our mortar is resting, our soft kneaded
        dough is divided into walnut-sized pieces and rolled out to be thin, our
        mortar is distributed homogeneously and cooked for 2 minutes between the
        flames of the wood fire.
